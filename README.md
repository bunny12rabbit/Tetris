# Tetris
Tetris Clone Game for Android made with Unity.
Used Zenject framework for implementing DI Container. All the game settings that can be customized through the Inspector, are in GameConfig scriptableObject file. All the media, exept Audio and UI buttons, is made by myself.
The game uses touch control by default (can be changed by substituing UserInput.cs class), sides of the screen is the Left and Right move, buttom part of the screen (1/5) is also devided by two - left is the Down move and right is the Rotate.
By pressing Back hardware button (or ESC on Windows) on your phone, pause menu is called.
